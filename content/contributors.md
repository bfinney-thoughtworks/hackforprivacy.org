I was never too concerned with digital privacy, until I noticed I was second-guessing what I’d type into Google, because I didn’t know who was watching and recording. Then I started to find out that others felt the same, and read about the [chilling effect of mass surveillance](https://theintercept.com/2016/04/28/new-study-shows-mass-surveillance-breeds-meekness-fear-and-self-censorship/) on free thought and speech. As governments and corporations continue to extend their reach into our personal lives, we have an opportunity and a responsibility to defend our own, and others’ privacy.
