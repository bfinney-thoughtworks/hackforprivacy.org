+++

Following on from our hugely successful [kick off](/post/we-came-we-saw-we-planned.html), it's now time to kick off our contributions to open source projects that enhance privacy for 2016.

We're kicking off our next series of hack nights on 10th February at [6:30pm AEDT (UTC+11)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Cryptohack+Virtual+Hack+Night&iso=20160210T1830&p1=152) with a virtual hack night -- we'll meet on Slack with Cryptohackers from around the world.

Come and work on whatever privacy tool you think needs our help, or join us in focusing on [Pixelated](https://pixelated-project.org) -- we'll be available to help you get the project context and navigate the codebase, and we'll have some documentation plus video and audio to help get everyone up and running.   

Let us know you're coming now by signing in to [Slack](https://cryptohack.slack.com/) (you'll have to [join](https://cryptohack.herokuapp.com) first) and opening the channel (our meeting place for the day): `/join #10th-feb-hacknight`, or RSVP:
