# What is [Pixelated](https://pixelated-project.org/)?
  Encrypted email made easy, so easy that the end-user doesn't even have to know what PGP is in order to send an encrypted email to someone.

  It has two components:

  0. **User Agent**: It's the web based client. [Try it yourself](https://try.pixelated-project.org:8080/auth/login?next=%2F).


  0. **Dispatcher**: TODOOOO (HELP MUCH NEEDED HERE!)
