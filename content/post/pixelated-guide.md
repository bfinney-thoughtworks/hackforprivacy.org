# What is [Pixelated](https://pixelated-project.org/)?
  Encrypted email made easy.
  That means the end-user doesn't even have to know what PGP is in order to send an encrypted email to someone.

  It has two components:

  - User Agent: Web based client (Think of it as what Gmail is), try it yourself. (link to demo)
  - Dispatcher

  Something about LEAP

  In this [Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/thoughtworks/pixelated-why-secure-communication-is-essential), the main Pixelated team talks about the project, and gives an overview of how it works.
