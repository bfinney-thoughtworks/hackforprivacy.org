+++

We've scheduled our kick off meetup in Melbourne for 18th January. We'll run a special introduction to the group for new members, reset our goals for the year, listen to a quick talk about a privacy-related topic, and get to work on contributing to a privacy-enhancing open source tool.

<p class="center"><a class="button" href="http://www.meetup.com/cryptohack-melbourne/events/227170695/"><strong>RSVP</strong></a></p>

In the mean time, please [join us on Slack](https://cryptohack.herokuapp.com), which will be the base of our operations for next year.
