Hopefully you've seen our virtual hack nights [sometime](announcing-10th-feb-virtual-hack-night.html) [in the last few months](announcing-2nd-march-virtual-hack-night.html). We've invited Cryptohackers, and folks who are new to our community to come together in the same virtual place and get stuff done. It is a format we've been experimenting with, so we can include as many Cryptohackers as possible and share skills, knowledge and contribute to open source projects like [Pixelated](https://pixelated-project.org).

We're pleased to announce that we're locking in a regular monthly timeslot for our virtual hack nights. We're going to be Cryptohacking on the last Wednesday night of each month (Melbourne time). __The first one is going to be Wednesday 27th April, starting at 7:30pm(AEST).__

It'll be a little different to previous hack nights, where we'd try and focus our collective efforts to help out the Pixelated team. With these new regular events, we want to create more of a virtual co-working space, where everyone can work on whatever privacy stuff they're passionate about right now and share your ideas and passion. That might be Pixelated, it might be writing a blog post, or preparing a talk. Whatever you're working on, mark the dates in your calendar and come and work on it with us. Other Cryptohackers might even be able to help you out!

If you are keen to contribute to the privacy movement, but don't have something to work on right now, here are some ideas we've had that you could work on:

* Pixelated (We'll have some issues picked out)
* Umbrella (Hopefully we'll have stuff to work on)
* Translate Pixelated video captions (Talk to Pam if you're keen)
* Write a blog post (we'll post it on cryptohack.net, and/or send it out to our networks) (Talk to Pam, Cam, Robin or Andrew)
* Bring your own privacy project, and tell us all about it
* Chat about privacy issues in the news (Talk to everybody!)
