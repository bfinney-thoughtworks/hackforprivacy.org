A few weeks ago Robin & Andrew were interviewed on the [crypto gossip podcast](http://cryptogoss.com/).

We talked about:

* the attacks on privacy in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks,
* the importance of digital privacy,
* [the data retention laws](https://cryptohack.net/post/data-retention-is-rubbish.html),
* cryptoparties,
* [the Pixelated project](https://pixelated-project.org/),
* and why we started the cryptohack network.

Check it out [here](https://soundcloud.com/cryptogoss/cryptogoss-15-9dec2015) (our bit starts around 24 mins).

Thanks to Dale and Peter for having us on the show!
