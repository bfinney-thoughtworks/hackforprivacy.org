The Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal â€œnegotiated" between a dozen countries including the US and Australia is an attack on our health, the environment, and civil liberties, for the benefit of big pharma, Hollywood copyright abusers, and evil megacorps everywhere. 

It allows corporations to sue governments in secret courts for introducing laws that harm their profits. And it will bring little-to-zero economic benefit to Australia. The Australian government refused to allow an independent inquiry but there is a parliamentary committee which is open to submissions from anyone until Friday: take 2 minutes to make a quick, easy submission telling our government to reject the TPP once and for all.

This: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/how-tpp-will-affect-you-and-your-digital-rights is an excellent summary of the myriad ways that the TPP will harm our civil liberties. Here are my personal highlights:

* Lose autonomy and control over legally purchased devices and content because it is a crime to remove its digital locks or Digital Rights Management (DRM). This means modifying, repairing, recycling, or otherwise tinkering with a digital device or its contents could be banned or is at least legally risky.
* Safety of devices and networks could be compromised because the TPP bans countries from requiring source-code disclosure and code auditing for most software and devices.
* Criminal or civil penalties for publishing information that reveals a corporate "trade secret" and is accessed, disclosed, or made available through any kind of computer system, even if it is for the purpose of revealing corporate wrongdoing. They could face criminal liabilities for publishing information from sources whom they know obtained the information improperly.
* It is a separate criminal offence to share the knowledge or tools to unlock DRM restrictions.
* Repairing a part in a car with embedded software may be a crime if it requires circumvention of the car's DRM.
* Excessive copyright terms of life of the creator plus 70 years keep digital creative works, including software, locked behind onerous restrictions for longer.
* The TPP would prohibit countries from requiring products be supplied with open source licenses, even where this would be helpful to curb rampant information security problems.
