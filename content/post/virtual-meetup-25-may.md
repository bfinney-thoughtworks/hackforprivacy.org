+++

Our next virtual hack night is this Wednesday (25th May). This time we are going to focus on scratching our own itch -- the Pixelated development environment. To kick off, Andrew will speak for 30 mins about why free and open source software is essential for digital privacy, followed by Q&A (technology permitting).

Then we'll roll into our hack night.

We've run lots of Pixelated hack nights, and we've spent a lot of time getting people's development environments up and running.

We want to make that quicker and easier, so we need people with a certain set of skills to help us out, particularly in infrastructure automation and devops -- technologies like Vagrant and Puppet -- and Python.

Please come along to Slack, and if you have friends with these skills, we would love to have them along too.

Cheers, 
The Cryptohack crew
