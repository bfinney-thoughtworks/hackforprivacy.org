+++

Welcome to 2016! This is going to be a big year for the effort to reclaim our privacy judging by the passion displayed by the Cryptohackers who met on Monday evening this week. 50 Cryptohackers met in Melbourne, talked about why privacy is important and imagined what impact we could have on the privacy movement in the next year and over the next five years.

We've collated the plethora of ideas, and four themes have emerged:

- Tech
- Privacy awareness and engagement
- Politics and legislation
- Cryptohack

Tech is an important theme for Cryptohack - we are a network of technologists after all, so our biggest impact is likely to be in the tech sphere. We believe free/libre open source sofware (FLOSS) is key for the privacy movement, which is why one of our main purposes is contributing to make crypto tools better.

Cryptohack started in Melbourne, but at the moment we are 300+ Cryptohackers in over 20 timezones. We want to benefit from such diversity and have a wider understanding of the state of privacy (or lack thereof) in all corners of the world.

We think this should be a collective effort, if the reach of some corporations is global so should be our efforts. If you're interested in contributing to this discussion or projects, [join us on Slack](https://cryptohack.herokuapp.com/).


# The ideas

The brainstorming method we used asked the Cryptohackers to catapult themselves one year, then 5 years into the future, and imagine what impact we've had on the world.

## 1 year

### Privacy awareness & engagement

- More people care about protecting their privacy.
- We publish and maintain a list of sites/apps which violate or compromise privacy.
- We publish writing on the history of privacy.
- Privacy workshops and education campaigns.
    - Gamify privacy.

### Tech

- More usable privacy tools.
- Cryptohackers contribute to a Pixelated major release.
- Make it easy to find a privacy project to contribute to.
- Improve documentation.
- 1000 commits to FLOSS privacy projects under the Cryptohack banner.
- Increase the number of sites using HTTPS.

### Politics & legislation

- Prevent ratification of the [Trans-Pacific-Partnership](http://aftinet.org.au/cms/trans-pacific-partnership-agreement).
- Reversal of the [data retention laws](https://robindoherty.com/2015/10/07/your-digital-privacy-ends-this-time-next-week.html).

- Decent privacy-focused smartphone is released.
- Email encryption is ubiquitous.
    - Find a way to hide metadata.
    - Email servers are easier to set up and run.
    - Usable on all devices.

### Privacy awareness & engagement

- Create a privacy kit that covers different kinds of privacy protection.

- Children’s picture book on privacy (Spot and The Government Watchdog).
- Privacy info exists in many languages.
- Libraries continue their privacy fights.

### Cryptohack

- International Cryptohack conference.
- Cryptohacker in parliament.
- Cryptohack is an authoritative voice in the media on tech and privacy issues.

## Things that support us in achieving our goals

- Internal talent.
    - Robin's writing.
- Cryptohack network, collaboration, passion and knowledge.
- Cryptohack is international.
    - We can speak many languages between us.
- Cryptohackers have the knowledge of tech and issues - better than our opponents.
