WhatsApp’s privacy policy just got terrible -- they will now allow businesses to contact you, and they’ll share your phone number, your contacts, the last time you used the app, and [other information](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#privacy-policy-information-we-collect) with [Facebook Inc](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678).

If privacy is important to you, install Signal and get your friends and family onto it -- more on how to do that at the [bottom of this page](#posters).

As for WhatsApp, you can make it a bit better by hardening its settings, [here is how](https://github.com/hackforprivacy/cryptohack.net/blob/master/content/post/harden-whatsapp-settings.md).

## So, what changed in terms of privacy?

In 2014, Facebook bought WhatsApp, an event that rang alarm bells for me and many others. WhatsApp responded with a blog [post](https://blog.whatsapp.com/529/Setting-the-record-straight) claiming: **“Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA”** and **“If partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldn’t have done it”**.

But it seems they have changed their values.

Two years later, on August 25th, WhatsApp changed its Terms and Privacy Policy and we all saw this message on our phones. Many of us just tapped on “Agree” without thinking twice, as we have unfortunately been [trained](http://darkpatterns.org/) to do. But this change is big and, in our opinions, dangerous.

**WhatsApp [says](https://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/general/28030011) you can choose not to share your information if you are an existing user. But they are quite deceptive.**

* By default you are sharing your information -- you need to explicitly opt out **before September 25**. [Here is how](https://www.whatsapp.com/faq/general/26000016).

* New users don’t have this choice -- do you want your friends to sign up to a service that doesn’t offer them control of their own information?

* Throughout the policy, WhatsApp uses the phrase _“to improve your Facebook ads and products experiences”._ Even if you opt out of the data being used in this way, it is still collected, and will be used in other ways.

Sharing your personal information by default, giving you a deadline for opting out, and denying new users this choice doesn’t sound like “Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA”.

**WhatsApp is no longer WhatsApp. It is Facebook.** [Privacy Zuckering](http://darkpatterns.org/facebook-com-august-2010/) is a phrase that was coined when Facebook introduced its woefully complicated privacy configuration, ensuring they could continue to benefit from our misunderstanding. Now they’ve Zuckered all over WhatsApp too.

Isn’t there a better way?

## Introducing Signal

[Signal](https://whispersystems.org/) is a secure messaging application, developed by [Open Whisper Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Whisper_Systems), who created the excellent [protocols](https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/) that other popular messenger apps have recently adopted to encrypt conversations. Its founder, Moxie Marlinspike, is a well-respected security researcher and a longtime advocate for [private communication made simple](https://vimeo.com/124887048).

### You are not the product
Signal is supported by donations and grants. They don’t have a business model, they don’t profit from building profiles of their users’ personal information.

### Private texts and calls
All messages and calls are private. Signal doesn’t have access to your conversations and no one else does either. In fact, unlike WhatsApp, Signal doesn’t even store [who talks to whom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)#Metadata).

### It is open source
Anyone can look at how the application is built and make sure it is safe, or suggest ways to improve it. Security by obscurity is not sufficient.

### Desktop Client
Signal has a desktop client (in beta) available for Android users on the Chrome Web Store.

## And now the hard bit
Given WhatsApp’s change of attitude towards privacy, it is time to move on and start using [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/), an app that allows you to communicate with the people you want without having to share personal data with advertising companies and other businesses.

Of course, the only reason to use Signal, WhatsApp, or any other communication app is to talk to other people, so if you’re convinced of Signal’s value, it’s now time to convince your friends and family! We’re going to try to help you out there -- please share these images far and wide.
