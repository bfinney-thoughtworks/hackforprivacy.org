[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) has recently announced it has entered public beta. This is great news for the privacy movement.

Let's Encrypt is a Certificate Authority (CA), and provides free (as in no cost), **trusted** certificates, tools that automate the request, **proper** installation and configuration of the certificate into webservers.

This is important as it means anyone running a website can sign up for a certificate and secure the traffic between their site and the people using it, which ensures data that people share with the site will be kept private.

It also means that as technologists, we have no more excuses for not configuring our websites to use HTTPS. If your site doesn't have an HTTPS interface, now is the time! [Go forth and encrypt!](https://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

Even community organisations like Cryptohack can now afford HTTPS -- check it out, we're using HTTPS!
