[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) has recently announced it has entered public beta. This is great news for the privacy movement.

Let's Encrypt is a certificate authority, and provides free (as in no cost), **trusted** certificates, and tools that automate the request, **proper** installation and configuration of the certificate into webservers.

This is important as it means everyone running a website can secure the traffic between their site and the people using it, which ensures any data that people share with the site will be kept private.

It also means that as technologists, we have no more excuses for not configuring their site to use https. If your site doesn't have https, now is the time! [Go forth and encrypt!](https://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

Even community organisations like cryptohack can now afford https (check it out, we're using https)!
