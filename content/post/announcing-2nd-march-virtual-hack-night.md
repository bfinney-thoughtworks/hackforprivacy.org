The next in our series of virtual hacknights will be on 2nd March at [7:00pm AEDT (UTC+11)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Cryptohack+Virtual+Hack+Night&iso=20160302T1900&p1=152) -- we'll meet on Slack with Cryptohackers from around the world.

Come and work on whatever privacy tool you think needs our help, or join us in focusing on [Pixelated](https://pixelated-project.org) -- we'll be available to help you get the project context and navigate the codebase, and we'll have some documentation plus video and audio to help get everyone up and running.   

Let us know you're coming now by signing in to [Slack](https://cryptohack.slack.com/) (you'll have to [join](https://cryptohack.herokuapp.com) first) and opening the channel #2nd-march-hacknight.
